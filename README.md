Sunny Glasses

Inspiration
Inspired by a deaf grandmother and her service dog, Sunny, this project aims to address daily communication challenges faced by the deaf community.

What It Does
Translates sign language to speech using machine learning and computer vision.
Converts speech to subtitles for seamless two-way communication.

How We Built It
Trained a custom TensorFlow model for sign recognition with computer vision.
Integrated OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text translation.
Transitioned from Raspberry Pi to a more powerful system for real-time processing.

Challenges
Overcoming hardware limitations with Raspberry Pi.
Building and curating a robust dataset for sign language recognition.

Accomplishments
Developed a functional ML model for sign recognition.
Created a custom dataset to train and test our system.

What’s Next
Optimize for portability, efficiency, and real-world use, turning Sunny Glasses into a scalable product for the deaf community.
