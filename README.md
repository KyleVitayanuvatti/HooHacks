## 💡 Inspiration  
Sunny Glasses is inspired by my deaf grandmother and her service dog, Sunny, to address everyday communication barriers in the deaf community.  

---

## 🛠️ What It Does  
Sunny Glasses:  
- **Sign Language to Speech:** Converts sign language into spoken English using ML and computer vision.  
- **Speech to Subtitles:** Displays spoken language as subtitles for two-way communication.
- **Video demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2t2YR184yY&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fdevpost.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY
